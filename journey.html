            <h5>Group Formation & Roles</h5>
            <p>Our team came together because of our interest in creating a strong project to put on our personal portfolio. When discussing project teaming and agreement, we came up with these following rules:    </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Commitment</strong>: Spend 5-7 hours outside of class on a typical week, 30-40 hours in the last week.</li>
                <li><strong>Expectations</strong>: Call people out if someone is slacking off, and if it gets worse, involve the teaching team.</li>
                <li><strong>Project Manager</strong>: We decided a Project manager system, where Heesung will manage timelines and making sure work gets done.</li>

                <h5>Timeline Management</h5>
                <p>To ensure that we stayed on track, we used a Gantt chart to visualize the project timeline and assign clear, descriptive tasks to each team member. This improved accountability and helped us better understand how limited our time was for completing the project. </p>

            <p>We had many ideas, such as a Red Light Green Light Robot, CNC Tube Notcher, wall climbing robot, and more. Using a Pugh Matrix, we ended up with <strong>BoxBot.</strong> At this current stage, we didn't know exactly how we wanted to manipulate the box. </p>

<p>After settling on what we wanted the project to do, we spent several days figuring out what mechanism we wanted on the BoxBot. After several hours, we ended up with a U shaped robot, where the sides will be moved by a <strong>rack and pinion system</strong> while the box will be lifted up through a <strong></strong> mechanism. </p>            </div>

            <p>
                Our goal was to validate the U-shaped drivetrain. Having designed based on the mini-project 3, 
                we separated the two sections and added a rack and pinion on the other side. This rapid prototyping 
                was able to help us test the squeeze functionality with the rack and pinion. The learnings that the 
                mechanical team had was to switch to Omni Wheel, and have a middle section to keep the electrical in place.

                release to all work. This was all controlled through serial connection.

                    <h5>V1 Drivebase updates</h5>
                    <p>Throughout phase 3, we went through 2 different iterations of the design. <strong>Version 1</strong> had a rack and pinion system driven by a stepper motor, where we left room for electrical in the back. We also added omni wheels for easier side to side movement with multi-directional caster wheels to support the weight of the robot and the box.</p>
                    <p>Some of the changes we needed to make was that the caster wheel was misaligned with the omni wheels, the necessity of linear rails for stability and precision, Camera Mounts for Vision, and a better support system for the rack so it doesn't wobble.</p>

                    <h5>V2 Drivebase updates</h5>
                    <p>For <strong>version 2</strong>, we added linear rails for stability, and made sure that the omni wheels and the caster wheels were designed to keep the robot parallel and as low to the ground as possible. We also added the 3 caster wheels on the center plate for more support. Something that we also worked on was keeping the rack stable, so we created rack guides that helped stabilize the drive base. The camera mount was designed as well.</p>
                    <p>Some of the changes we need to make was a adjustable camera mount, have extra caster wheels on the drivebases, and make space for electrical mounting. We also needed longer linear rails, and have the linear rails sandwich the rack and pinion system.</p>

                    <p>Some of the changes that we needed to do was optimize the brackets, and we had to design for a full lead screw instead of a bolts.</p>
