            <h5>Group Formation & Roles</h5>
            <p>Our team came together because of our interest in creating a strong project to put on our personal portfolio. When discussing project teaming and agreement, we came up with these following rules:    </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Commitment</strong>: Spend 5-7 hours outside of class on a typical week, 30-40 hours in the last week.</li>
                <li><strong>Expectations</strong>: Call people out if someone is slacking off, and if it gets worse, involve the teaching team.</li>
                <li><strong>Project Manager</strong>: We decided a Project manager system, where Heesung will manage timelines and making sure work gets done.</li>
            </ul>

                <h5>Timeline Management</h5>
                <p>To ensure that we stayed on track, we used a Gantt chart to visualize the project timeline and assign clear, descriptive tasks to each team member. This improved accountability and helped us better understand how limited our time was for completing the project. </p>

                <h5>Honing a Singular Idea</h5>
            <p>We had many ideas, such as a Red Light Green Light Robot, CNC Tube Notcher, wall climbing robot, and more. Using a Pugh Matrix, we ended up with <strong>BoxBot</strong> because it was something that everyone was committed to do, it was complex, and it was scalable to be more difficult/easier. At this current stage, we didn't know exactly how we wanted to manipulate the box. </p>

                <h5>Figuring out the weeds</h5>
<p>After settling on what we wanted the project to do, we spent several days figuring out what mechanism we wanted on the BoxBot. After several hours, we ended up with a U shaped robot, where the sides will be moved by a <strong>rack and pinion system</strong> while the box will be lifted up through a <strong></strong> mechanism. </p>            </div>

                <h5>Design Process</h5>
                <p>Although we will dive deeper into the design in itself throughout this website, there were several design
                    decisions we had to come up with. 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Chassis Geometry:</strong> Originally, we wanted to lift the box in front of the robot.
                        However, we came to the conclusion that it was too similar to a forklift. Because this was something 
                        that we didn't want to do, and that we wanted to make something more unique, we decided to lift the box 
                        by sandwiching it. This made the design decision as a <strong>U-shaped Chassis.</strong>

                        
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Box manipulation: </strong> Since we figured out we wanted a U-shaped Chassis, we then had to 
                        figure out how exactly we wanted the robot to be in contact with it. We knew that the 2 sides of the chassis 
                        had to squeeze, but we were deciding between a scissor lift that open and closes left, a rack and pinion system, 
                        and a belt system. We decided to go with a <strong>rack and pinion system</strong> because this was something 
                        we could rapidly test and 3D print. We had to wait for the belt system, so we came to the conclusion that rapid 
                        iteration will be more worthwhile.
                        </li>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Box Lifting: </strong> We had to figure out how we wanted to lift a box. We ended up with a <strong>scissor lift mechanism </strong>
                        on both sides. Since we had supports of both sides, we figured we can have a lift plate that gets under the cardboard box.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <p>
                Our goal was to validate the U-shaped drivetrain. Having designed based on the mini-project 3, 
                we separated the two sections and added a rack and pinion on the other side. This rapid prototyping 
                was able to help us test the squeeze functionality with the rack and pinion. The learnings that the 
                mechanical team had was to switch to Omni Wheel, and have a middle section to keep the electrical in place.

            <h5>Driving the prototype</h5>
            <p>
                Our initial electrical system was an evolution of MP3. Our goal was to re-use as many components as possible that we already were familiar with and that we had easy access to. We used an Arduino for logic and a motor shield for motor control.We supply the power to the motor via a wall outlet, making this prototype tethered. One takeaway from this prototype was the challenge of wire management on a robot that changes size, a challenge that we experienced throughout the design process.

            <p>
                We focused on building basic driving functionality code. We got forward, reverse, close, and release to all work. This was all controlled through serial connection to a laptop. Testing with a wired USB cable for serial connection proved cumbersome, prompting us to move to an alternative onboard microcontroller/computer for the next phase.

                    <p>Throughout phase 3, we went through 2 different iterations of the design. <strong>Version 1</strong> had a rack and pinion system driven by a stepper motor, where we left room for electrical in the back. We also added omni wheels for easier side to side movement with multi-directional caster wheels to support the weight of the robot and the box.</p>
                    <p>Some of the changes we needed to make was that the caster wheel was misaligned with the omni wheels, the necessity of linear rails for stability and precision, Camera Mounts for Vision, and a better support system for the rack so it doesn't wobble.</p>

                    <p>For <strong>version 2</strong>, we added linear rails for stability, and made sure that the omni wheels and the caster wheels were designed to keep the robot parallel and as low to the ground as possible. We also added the 3 caster wheels on the center plate for more support. Something that we also worked on was keeping the rack stable, so we created rack guides that helped stabilize the drive base. The camera mount was designed as well.</p>
                    <p>Some of the changes we need to make was a adjustable camera mount, have extra caster wheels on the drivebases, and make space for electrical mounting. We also needed longer linear rails, and have the linear rails sandwich the rack and pinion system.</p>

                    <p>Some of the changes that we needed to do was optimize the brackets, and we had to design for a full lead screw instead of a bolts.</p>

                    <p>Our software underwent a complete overhaul for this phase, evolving from basic serial control to a robust ROS2 Python software stack onboard the Raspberry Pi. Within the ROS2 ecosystem, we defined scaffolding for all software we would need to create. We created Nodes for teleoperation control, autonomous control, and drive logic. In this phase we successfully tested the teleoperation and drive control nodes, and laid the groundwork for future work with computer vision for autonomous driving. By the end of this sprint, we were able to wirelessly drive the robot and squeeze objects.</p>

                    <p>We spent a significant amount of time creating a finalized cable routing solution to prevent interference with the moving rack and pinion. We made custom length wire harnesses with quick-disconnect DuPont-style connectors for all components. We also used a solderable breadboard to create a permanent junction box for all components. All logic level connections followed standardized wire color rules. We also ensured our digital wiring diagram aligned with the physical system exactly. At this point, we also properly implemented our emergency stop button and fuse block. These measures protect the user from an out of control robot and the components from over-current.</p>

                    <p>We moved into the refinement stage for our drive software, ironing out bugs with drive code, getting to the stage where our robot reliably operated under teleoperation mode. With this accomplished, we were able to turn our attention to autonomous, which we worked on in parallel with the drive code updates outside of the ROS environment. We were able to detect April Tags with the camera, and generate simple drive commands to follow the tags. Unfortunately, we encountered a major roadblock when attempting to integrate this code into our ROS environment, and lost significant amount of time to resolving dependency issues with the RealSense Python library. As a result, we were unable to test autonomous before the end of the sprint, as originally planned.</p>

                    <p>We fully implemented our final scissor lift design and solved several issues that arose during integration. Mainly, we had to figure out spacing issues to fit the servo motors with the DC motors. We went through several iterations of mounts before arriving at a design that would comply with the DC motors without sacrificing over all lift height. One we had everything packaged properly, we worked to improve the overall stability of the scissor lift. The final piece of implementation was fixing the lift plate to the lift arms. </p>
