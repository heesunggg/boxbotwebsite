        <h2>⚙️ Detailed Mechanical Design and Analysis</h2>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">The BoxBot chassis and lifting mechanism were designed for stability, high payload capacity relative to size, and efficient maneuverability on flat surfaces. This section details the rationale for key structural choices and provides the necessary documentation for replication.</p>

            <h3>1. Final Chassis and Assembly Overview</h3>
            <p>Our final design utilizes a three-wheel differential drive configuration for reliable movement and precision steering. The chassis frame is constructed primarily from [Material, e.g., laser-cut ABS/Aluminum] to achieve an optimal balance of rigidity and weight. The key component visuals are shown below.</p>

            <h3>2. Lifting Mechanism and Gripper Analysis</h3>
            <p>The system employs a [Type of Mechanism, e.g., parallel four-bar linkage] powered by a [Type of Motor, e.g., geared DC motor] to achieve vertical lift. The gripper utilizes [Method, e.g., passive friction grips or powered clamp] optimized for the specific dimensions of the target cardboard box.</p>
            
            <h4>2.1. Structural Rationale and Trade-offs</h4>
            <p>Initial designs considered a scissor lift, but we ultimately chose the [Final Mechanism] due to its [Reason 1, e.g., lower part count] and [Reason 2, e.g., superior lateral stability] under eccentric loading. This choice directly impacted our material budget, allowing us to allocate more funds to motor power.</p>

            <h3>3. Load Bearing and Stress Analysis</h3>
            <p>To ensure structural integrity under maximum load, a simplified static load analysis was performed on the main chassis supports and the lift arm pivot points. The maximum expected force on the pivot joint is calculated as $F_{max} = m_{load} \cdot g + F_{dynamic}$.</p>
            
            <p>The chosen [Material, e.g., Plywood/Aluminum] provides a safety factor of $S_f = \frac{\sigma_{yield}}{\sigma_{max}} \approx 3.0$, which is acceptable for educational prototyping constraints.</p>
